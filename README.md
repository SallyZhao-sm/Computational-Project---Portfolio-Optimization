# Computational-Project---Portfolio-Optimization
Implemented and compared portfolio optimization models (MVO, Robust MVO, Risk Parity, Market-Cap Weighted) on S&amp;P 500 data using MATLAB. Applied rolling windows for out-of-sample tests, evaluated risk-return tradeoffs, and visualized results. Robust MVO showed downside protection, Risk Parity delivered stable long-term performance.
